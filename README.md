Turing
======
Turing is a Turing Machine simulator written in Ruby. A `TuringMachine` instance is instantiated with a rule-set, an array of `Rule` instances, and an initial tape state, an array of bits.

Purpose
-------
Turing will continue to be built out as a tool for working with Turing Machines and most likely joined with a generic Automata project. The goal is to provide the implementation, fully modularized, to allow for a `.turing` file, for example, to be provided as the source code to an experiment. Dealing with Turing Machines is a great way to understand computers on a fundamental level, an effort which this project aims to facilitate.
